# DataScienceCertificate-GroupB
This repository is for the Group B Data Science Certificate Team Project.

Original data files for the project are saved here.

R code will be saved here for all team members to access and share the latest version of the team project code. 
* A few housekeeping rules for working with the code. Please note the date the code was last updated and add your name as a collaborator under each section so we know who to ask about questions.
* We will assign one person to conduct code merges since we won't be using GitHub's push and pull functionality to manage code version control.
* If you use a function from a package not in the list in the 'package' code chunk, add it to the list and notify the team on the Teams chat that they will need to install a new package

Powerpoint files and reports will be saved in the Microsoft Teams channel, '<name>'
