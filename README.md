# DataScienceCertificate-GroupB
This repository is for the Group B Data Science Certificate Team Project.

Original data files for the project are saved here.

R code will be saved here for all team members to access and share the latest version of the team project code. 
* A few housekeeping rules for working with the code. Please note the date the code was last updated and add your name as a collaborator under each section so we know who to ask about the code.
* We will assign one person to conduct code merges since we won't be using GitHub's push and pull functionality to manage code version control. For this reason, when you have code changes, upload the R code using the following naming convention 'Data_Science_Certificate_Group_B_project_<initials>_yyyy-mm-dd.Rmd'. 
    + The person assigned to merge the code will incorporate all changes. 
* If you use a function from a package not in the list in the 'package' code chunk, add it to the list and notify the team on the Teams chat that they will need to install a new package

Powerpoint files and reports will be saved in the Microsoft Teams team [CDC-Data-Science-Certificate-Program](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a58d5a60b6efb4e07bf0048c16754b157%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=769c0a8b-507c-4225-a2f1-0e2dd62d0c8e&tenantId=9ce70869-60db-44fd-abe8-d2767077fc8f). We will use the Group B channel to store our files.
